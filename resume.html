<li>In April 2008, Comsys (now Experis) in Waltham, MA contracted me to
serve as a consultant for HP's Global Partner Learning 
program (now called ExpertOne).  Global Partner Learning was in the 
process of migrating their courseware from an older Cert-Pro system to a
more modern content management system, Saba Centra.  During this 
migration, I managed and supported older content while importing it for use 
in the new system, imported the logic for their certifications into Saba, and
created new courses according to a release timeline.  In October of 2008, 
my contract was renewed in a help desk/administration capacity. Today, I 
continue to support ExpertOne by publishing new courseware, 
troubleshooting for both administrators and learners, assigning and
managing privileges for instructors at Authorized Training Centers. Beginning in 2014, I assisted with the gathering of requirements and review of systems for the next revision of our LMS. I wrote user stories, test cases, and test scripts that were used for the acceptance testing we conducted at the Houston HP campus. </li>

experience obtained in my youth to work building and organizing a farm in 
Vermont.  The Thibeault Family has 200 undeveloped acres of land with a 
large country cottage built on it.  I worked under the supervision of Charlie 
Frost. They needed many repairs done to the house, along with the clearing of 
land, building of barns and other shelters, and gathering of firewood for the 
winter.  This work also necessitates the maintenance and occasional 
minor repair of trucks, tractors, chainsaws, and other farm machinery.  In 
addition to this, I also worked at Harvest Hill Organic Vegetable Farm for Bill Half assisting in the harvest, delivery, and sale of his crop during
Vermont's brief harvest season.</li>
